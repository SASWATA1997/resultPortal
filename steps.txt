hi friend
this  is my third video in this channel.
this video is not on problem and solution.
this video is on creating result webportal project. ASP.NET PROJECT

let me 1st show you my project.

this is  list of student with there result. i want to show their
result when the give their valid I.D/ROLL AND D.O.B

SEE.......

JUST A MOMENT MY SYSTEM IS LITTLE BIT SLOW :)

SEE....

LET SEE RESULT OF  Akhilesh

LET GIVE WRONG D.O.B OF AKHILESH...

NOW LET SEE RESULT OF Chanchal HE IS FAILED CANDIDATE.

I THINK YOU UNDERSTAND MY PROJECT....

LET DISCUSS HOW I MAKE THIS PROJECT.


BEFORE I SHOWING YOU STEPS 1ST I TELL YOU WHAT ARE THE COMPONENTS
I USED FOR THIS PROJECT.

1ST MASTER PAGE FOR THIS PAGE.

I THINK YOU ALL KNOW ABOUT MASTER PAGE. IF NOT PLEASE GOOGLE
IT.

CONTENT PAGE IS THE DYNAMIC PAGE IN THIS PROJECT.

NOW DOWNLOAD SAMPLE MASTER PAGE FROM BROWSER...

YOU CAN FIND MANY SAMPLE FROM THAT WEBSITE DOWNLOAD IT.
AS I ALREADY DOWNLOAD IT BEFORE SO I AM NOT FURTHER DOWNLOAD THAT.
FOR THIS PROJECT I USE "Educational Theory Free Website Template - Free-CSS.com"
THIS MASTER PAGE TEMPLETE
I USE THIS PART "full-width" AS MY MASTER PAGE......

STEP 1:
MASTER PAGE CREATION AND DATABASE TABLE CREATION.

A1.FOR MASTER PAGE.
YOU CAN CREATE OR DOWNLOAD FREE MASTER PAGE TEMPLATE FROM
BROWSER "https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates" PROVIDE
YOU AT DESCRIPTION.
AS I ALREADY HAVE A FREE MASTER PAGE TEMPLET. SO I USED THAT.

"2022_sound_master"THIS IS MY FREE MASTER PAGE TEMPLET FOLDER 
I USE THIS 

TO USE THIS IN MY PROJECT 1ST ADD IT'S CSS , JS FILE, OTHER NESSCERY
FILE.
IN PROJECT.

A1.
NOW CREATE A MASTER PAGE IN YOUR PROJECT NAME IT LIKE"MAINMASTER"
delete content prest in that master page and add your own
master page content
DELETE FROM HEADE TO BODY 

COPY AND PASTE IN PROJECT MASTER PAGE.

I DONT NEED THIS PART SO....

THIS PART IS MY DYNAMIC PAGE PART.... SHOW IN NEXT STEP.

A2.
DATABASE TABLE CREATION.
now as i migrate data from excel sheet to database so
i have to create table according to exacel.
as i have to create table with number of coloum present
in my excel table 

here A-L 12 coloum so i have to crete 12 coloum and
coloum name should be ordered according to name in this 
excel.
other wise data will not migrate

here coloum name is 
1.Roll_No	
2.Name	
3.Date_of_birth	
4.Accountancy	
5.English	
6.Maths	
7.Economics	
8.Business_Studies	
9.Total	
10.Average	
11.Grade	
12.Result

this order

and coloum name in database should be according to coloum
present in excel list

example:
as in excel coloum name for Business_Studies is 
*Business_Studies*
coloum name should be "Business_Studies"
if in database coloum name be
 Business Studies/business_studies in this format
magration not happned

i already have ddl query for this table . so i used that
but when you create plese check it quietly otherwise
error happned... :)

END OF STEP1....

STEP2:
DATA MIGRATION AND CONTENT PAGE CREATION

A1.
FOR DATA MIGRATION FROM EXCEL TO DATABASE YOU HAVE TO IMPORT
YOUR EXCEL SHEET TO MYSQL DATA BASE..
SO FOR THIS WATCH THROUGHLY....

IN DATA SOURCE GIVE THE SOURCE OF DATA FROM WHICH
YOU WANT TO IMPORT
IN THIS CASE DATA SOURCE IS MS EXCEL.
IF U WANT TO IMPORT FROM OTHER SOURCE GIVE THAT SOURCE.

FILE PATH: WHICH FILE YOUR FILE NAME 
IN THIS CASE FILE NAME IS

NOW FROM WHICH SHEET YOU WANT TO IMPORT DATA
IN THIS CASE SHEET NO IS
IMPORT DATA TO WHICH TABLE IN THIS DATABASE.
HERE TABLE NAME DBO.STUDENTLIST

PRIVEW THE DATA ... AS IT IMPORT IT CORRECT MANER OR NOT
OR IMPORT FROM EXACT FILE OR NOT.

LET'S CHECK IN MY DATABASE.

FINE..... :)
 A2.
DYNAMIC PAGE/CONTENT PAGE
SO TO USE MASTER PAGE IN CONTENT PAGE 1ST WE HAVE TO MAKE
A FORM AND ADD CONENTPLACEHOLDER IN MASTER PAGE.
NOW CONTENT PAGE USE THAT PART OTHER WISE YOU WILL NOT ADD
LABEL, BUTTON IN CONTENT PAGE.

ADD A CONTENT PAGE / CONTENT WEBFROM WITH MASTER PAGE
 IN YOUR PROJECT.
NAME IT JUST LIKE "RESULTCHECK";
THIS PAGE IS THE 1ST CONTENT PAGE HERE STUDENT
GIVE ROLL AND DOB  TO ENTER INTO TO RESULTSITE.

CREATE ANOTHER CONTENT PAGE WITH WEB FROM WHERE YOU DISPLAY
RESULT.

HERE I SHOW DATA IN TABLE FORMAT SO FOR THIS I CREATE ASPX 
TABLE.

I ALREADY HAVE THIS TABLE FORMAT SO I USED THIS WITHOUT
WASTING TIME.
I GIVE THIS FORMAT IN DESCRIPTION.

end of step2......

STEP3:
JQUERY FOR CALANDER AND DATABASE CONNECTION:

NOW RESULTSHOW AND RESULTCHECK ARE TWO CONTENT PAGE FOR THIS PROJECT
AND I DEVELOP REST PART BY ONLY USE THIS TWO PAGES.

A1.
JQUERY FOR CALANDER:
LET ME SHOW YOU MY PROJECT AGAIN.

TO DISPLAY CALANDER IN MY PROJECT ASPX HAVE CALNDER ELEMENT.
BUT IF WE USE THIS WE CANNOT CONTROLL YEAR AND MONTH IN THIS CALANDER 
JUST LIKE THIS

TO USE THIS WE HAVE TO CREATE A JQUERY IN OUR PROJECT.
HERE I'M USING THIS CALANDER IN "RESULTCHECK.ASPX" CONTENT PAGE
SO CREATE A JQUERY IN THAT PAGE.

WRITE YOUR QUERY INSIDE CONTENT PLACEHOLDER TAG NOT OUT SIDE.
OTHERWISE YOU CANNOT USE THAT JQUERY.

TO USE JQUERY CODE LINK SOME JQUERY FILE AT THE TOP and IN MASTER PAGE.
EITHER USE CDN OR DOWNLOAD IT.
I DOWNLOAD JQUERY FILE. SO I USE OFFLINE LINK.

YOU CAN DOWNLOAD OFFLINE FILE FORM.
https://jquery.com/download/
Download the compressed, production jQuery 3.6.0<-THIS FILE
AND

DOWNLOAD FORM https://jqueryui.com/download/

attached jquery file in main master otherwise u cannot use jquery in ur
content page. inside head tag in mainmaster page.
  
if u want to make a button use.

A2.
DATABASE CONNECTION.
I THINK YOU ALL KNOW ABOUT DATABASE CONNECTION. IF NOT FOLLOW STEPS.

i think you throughly follow steps .
this dbcon is database alise name whiCh i use in every coding.

end 0f step 3....... 

STEP4:
C# CODING & QUERY STRING. 

A1.FOR PAGE RESULTCHECK.ASPX

IN THIS PAGE WE HAVE TO CHECK IF ALL DETALIS PRESENT FOR ROLL NO GIVEN
CORRECT OR NOT IF CORRECT THEN WE PASS ID  VALUE TO NEXT PAGE
HERE RESULTSHOW.ASPX
SO FIRST I CHECK THE DETALIS FROM FRONT END TO BACKEND DATABASE.

/*using System.Configuration;
using System.Data.SqlClient;
using System.Data;*/

THIS THREE SYSTEM FILE IS IMPORTANT FOR DATABASE CONNECTION WITH FORNT END
 string strCon = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["<database alise name>"].ConnectionString ;
important for connection.

YOU SEE UPTO POGRAMME WORKS FINE.
NOW COMES THE MOST IMPORTANT PART IS PASSING ID TAKEN FROM "RESULTCHECK"
PAGE TO RESULTSHOW PAGE.
WE SOLVE THIS BY USING QUERYSTRING.

NOW

 Response.Redirect("resultShow.aspx?Roll_No="+txt_id.Text+"");
by this txt_id value i send to resultShow page through query.

A2.
coding for resultShow page

by using query string we fetch id value passing from the previous page.

END OF STEP4.....

LET RUN.....

let's give wrong d.o.b

let check for failed student


THANK YOU ............
